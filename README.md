# Peerfect-Circle-Calculator
Circle Perfection Calculator is a web app that lets users draw shapes and calculates how close they are to a perfect circle. Built with Flask and OpenCV, it analyzes the drawing, calculates the deviation, and provides a perfection score from 0% to 100%, indicating how accurate the shape is.
