## Description

**Circle Perfection Calculator** is a web app that lets users draw shapes and calculates how close they are to a perfect circle. Built with Flask and OpenCV, it analyzes the drawing, calculates the deviation, and provides a **perfection score** from **0% to 100%**, indicating how accurate the shape is.

## Features
- Draw on a canvas and submit the shape.
- Get a perfection score based on how close the drawing is to a perfect circle.
- Simple and responsive user interface.
- Built using **Flask** for the backend and **OpenCV** for geometric calculations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Backend programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the app
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and circle detection
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For frontend user interface and interaction
- **AJAX (Fetch API)**: To send drawing data to the backend without reloading the page
